## üì¶ 0.33.0 - Added Recording and Replays

This version adds support for recording and replaying battles (#55: Game replays). All credits go
to [Jan Durovec](https://github.com/jandurovec) for this cool feature! ü§©

It is now possible to record a battle and replay it later. This is useful for debugging and for replaying battles that
you have recorded. When replaying a battle, you can see the replay timeline and seek to a specific point in the battle.
Skulls on the timeline show when a bot has killed.

Note that the replays also make it possible to study the standard output of the bots in the bot consoles and also see
the properties and events at specific points in the battle.

### üöÄ Improvements

- Recorder:
    - #55: A new **recorder** application was added, which is a command-line tool for recording battles.

- GUI app:
    - #159: Replay feature added.
    - #160: Added replay timeline and allow seeking.
    - #161: Updated round/turn indicator in the arena panel.

### üêû Bug Fixes

- Server, Booter, Recorder:
    - Got rid of `WARNING: A restricted method in java.lang.System has been called` when running with Java 22 or later.

- Booter:
    - Bots could not be booted on Linux. Thanks goes to [Yang Li](https://github.com/yangli2) for fixing this. ‚ù§Ô∏è

## üì¶ 0.32.1 - No need of default constructor - 01-Jul-2025

### üöÄ Improvements

- Bot API:
    - The `BaseBot()` constructor (instead of `Bot()` constructor) now automatically searches for the bot config file (
      .json) and falls back on using environment variables if the config file could not be found.
    - The sample bots could not start up due to this issue.

### üêû Bug Fixes

- Booter
    - Fixed the escaping issue with double backslash characters.
- Sample Bot:
    - Fixed a bug in TrackFire.cs where the turret misaligned while attempting to lock onto a target, causing it to
      oscillate erratically during target acquisition.

## üì¶ 0.32.0 - Added Booter Error Log - 24-Jun-2025

This version makes it easier to figure out why a bot will not boot from a bot directory.

### üöÄ Improvements

- Booter:
    - The Booter now logs errors to standard error. Each error is recorded with the name of the bot directory in which
      the error occurred.

- GUI:
    - When booting one or more bots that crash with an error, the error is written to a Booter Error Log window. This
      window automatically appears and displays the detected errors for each bot directory that caused an error.

- Bot API:
    - The `Bot()` constructor now automatically searches for the bot config file (.json) and falls back on using
      environment variables if the config file could not be found.
        - Due to this change, the default constructor has been removed from all sample bots.

## üì¶ 0.31.0 - Improved Graphical Debugging - 19-Jun-2025

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

#### Bot API Updates

If you are using `Color` and the `getGraphics()` method or `Graphics` property, you may need to update your bot(s).

**Changes Implemented:**

- Platform-specific graphics classes and external graphics libraries, such as those for SVG, have been replaced with the
  following classes:
    - `IGraphics`
    - `SvgGraphics`
    - `Color`
    - `Point`

**Reasons for Changes:**

- Simplify the development and maintenance of the debugging graphics feature.
- Avoid using platform-specific features and frameworks that are not compatible across all platforms and operating
  systems.
- Enhance the speed of SVG serialization, reduce RAM usage, and decrease distribution archive sizes.
- Standardize the API for debug painting across all Bot APIs (Java, .Net, Python, etc.).

**Specific Updates:**

- **Java:** A new package `dev.robocode.tankroyale.botapi.graphics` has been introduced.
- **.Net:** A new namespace `Robocode.TankRoyale.BotApi.Graphics` has been introduced.

**Additional Information:**

- Sample bots have been updated to use the new classes.

### üêû Bug Fixes

- BotAPI:
    - #143: .NET bot fails to start with no or invalid country code.
    - #144: .NET bots run only on Windows since 0.30.0.
        - SvgNet requires `System.Drawing`, which is not available on Linux and macOS. Hence, the new Robocode specific
          `IGraphics` interface must be used instead.
    - Fixed the generated bot Bash scripts for .Net so `dotnet build` will be called if the `bin` folder is missing.
- GUI:
    - Fixed multiple issues with the "No bot directory root has been configured" error dialog.

## üì¶ 0.30.2 - GUI auto-scales the Battle View - 02-Jun-2025

### üöÄ Improvements

- GUI:
    - The GUI now automatically scales the battle view when it‚Äôs first displayed and adjusts it dynamically as the
      window is resized.
      screen only. This is helpful when running on systems with multiple screens.
        - Thanks to [Jan Durovec](https://github.com/jandurovec) for this nice improvement. ‚ù§Ô∏è
    - Windows now open on the "active" screen where the mouse cursor is located instead of showing up on the primary.
    - Fixed an issue where Robocode could get stuck showing a black window.

### üêû Bug Fixes

- Server:
    - #132: Fixed several race conditions and synchronization issues on the server side.
- BotAPI / Sample Bots:
    - Fixed issue where the Fire sample bot did not lock the radar on its target.
- Sample Bots:
    - The `Fire` and `MyFirstBot` sample bot did not turn perpendicular to the bullet direction anymore, and the RamFire
      did not drive directly towards its target.
- Documentation:
    - #136: The turn timeout and ready timeout were incorrectly specified in ~~milliseconds~~ instead of **microseconds
      **.
      1 millisecond = 1/1,000 of a second, where 1 microsecond = 1/1,000,000 of a second

## üì¶ 0.30.1 - Fixes to sample bots - 08-Mar-2025

This version provides bug fixes to the sample bots only.

### üêû Bug Fixes

- Sample Bots: Corners and Walls did not turn correctly towards the wall.

## üì¶ 0.30.0 - Added Graphics Debugging - 07-Feb-2025

### üöÄ #116: Graphical Debugging Implemented Using SVG

**Graphical debugging**, known from the original game, has been implemented using SVG with the [JSVG] library. This
allows you to paint graphics objects on the battlefield while the game is running, making it easier to visualize
elements such as estimated target positions. This feature is available for both the Java API and .Net API.

#### Java API

- Use the new `getGraphics()` method to return a `java.awt.Graphics2D` object for painting objects.
- Thanks to [Tobias Zimmermann](https://github.com/Cu3PO42) for bringing this feature to the Bot Java API, for
  suggesting the use of SVG and [JSVG], and also adding `transform-box` to JSVG to mirror texts. ‚ù§Ô∏è
- Thanks also to [Jannis Weis](https://github.com/weisJ) for providing [JSVG] and helping fix an issue with using the
  correct libraries for JSVG. Make sure to [buy him a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/weisj). üòä

#### .Net API

- Get a `SvnNet.SvgGraphics` context for painting by using the `Graphics` getter.
- The .Net API uses the [SvgNet](https://github.com/managed-commons/SvgNet) library. The `SvgGraphics` is context used
  similarly to
  [System.Drawing.Graphics](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.drawing.graphics?view=windowsdesktop-6.0).

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Graphical Debugging must be enabled before anything is rendered to the battlefield.**

#### Enabling Graphical Debugging

Graphical debugging can be enabled from the Properties pane of the bot console by toggling the
`Toggle Graphical Debugging` button. Graphical debugging _is not_ enabled per default, and must be applied to individual
bots.

#### Sample Bots

A new sample bot, PaintingBot, has been introduced to showcase the use of debug painting in both Java and C#.

#### Schema changes

- A new `debugGraphics` (string) field has been added to the `bot-intent` schema. This field allows you to provide SVG
  content as a string, which will be rendered if debugging graphics is enabled. Note that not all SVG functionality is
  supported by [JSVG](https://github.com/weisJ/jsvg) used for rendering SVG onm the battlefield.

- A new `isDebuggingEnabled` (boolean) field has been added to the `bot-state` schema. This field specifies whether the
  debugging graphics feature is enabled for the bot. The `debugGraphics` field will only be used if `isDebuggingEnabled`
  is set to `true`.

### üêû Bug Fixes

- Server:
    - Log messages printed out `{}` instead of content.
- GUI:
    - Fixed issue with the switch button in the Server Options for switching between using a local and remote server.

## üì¶ 0.29.0 - All about colors - 19-Jan-2024

This version causes a breaking change for the Color class. The Color class was removed and replaced with the Color class
used with the used platform (Java or C#).

### üöÄ Improvements

- Server:
    - Replaced SLF4J's SimpleLogger with own implementation based on the SLF4J API to provide ANSI colors on log levels.
- Bot API:
    - Replaced using Robocode's Color class with `java.awt.Color` for Java and `System.Drawing.Color` for C#.
- Sample Bots:
    - Updated to use the Color class from the used platform (Java or C#).

## üì¶ 0.28.1 - Fixed Survival Scores - 01-Jan-2025

### üêû Bug Fixes

- Server:
    - #122: Fixed the scoring issue with Survival Score and Last Survivor Bonus, which became too large after multiple
      rounds.
    - The server now only listens to the wildcard IP address (0.0.0.0), meaning it will listen on all available network
      interfaces for the specified port (IPv4 and IPv6) on the system.

## üì¶ 0.28.0 - Inherited Socket Support - 21-Dec-2024

### üöÄ Improvements

- Server:
    - **#115: Inherited Socket Support**: You can now start the server with an inherited socket from another process by
      setting `--port=inherit` or `-p=inherit`.
    - **Socket Activation**: This enables the use of [Socket Activation], such as with `systemd` or `xinetd` on Linux.
    - **Lazy Loading**: With socket activation, the server will only start when a client accesses the port for the first
      time.
    - **Setup Guide**: A detailed guide for setting up socket activation for the Robocode server is
      provided [here](https://github.com/robocode-dev/tank-royale/blob/main/server/docs/systemd-socket-activation.md).
    - **Acknowledgements**: Special thanks to [Tobias Zimmermann](https://github.com/Cu3PO42) for bringing this feature
      to Robocode! ‚ù§Ô∏è
    - **Java WebSocket**: Gratitude to [Marcel Prestel](https://github.com/marci4) for providing and maintaining the
      excellent [Java WebSocket](https://tootallnate.github.io/Java-WebSocket/) library, making WebSockets accessible
      for small stand-alone Java applications without the need for a traditional server. üèÜ

### üêû Bug Fixes

- Bot API:
    - The internal event handling for state updates in the Bot API is now separated from bot event queue handling.
      Internal events are processed immediately, while bot events are eventually processed through the event queue,
      if at all.

## üì¶ 0.27.0 - Lots of bug fixes - 02-Dec-2024

This version fixes various issues, some found when running legacy bots with the [Robocode API Bridge].

### üöÄ Improvements

- Bot API for .Net:
    - Improved performance of event handling by replacing `ImmutableList` and `ImmutableHashSet` with `List` and
      `HashSet` protected with `lock` blocks.
- Bot API for Java:
    - Improved performance of event handling by replacing `CopyOnWriteArrayList` with
      `synchronizedList(new ArrayList<>())`.

### üêû Bug Fixes

- Server:
    - #117: Server process consumed 100% of a CPU core even when the game is paused (due to nano timing).
        - Thank you, [Tobias Zimmermann](https://github.com/Cu3PO42), for spotting and fixing this nasty issue! ‚ù§Ô∏è
- Bot API:
    - [#1](https://github.com/robocode-dev/robocode-api-bridge/issues/1): Wrapped bot throws an exception. Fixes in both
      the Bot API and [Robocode API Bridge](https://github.com/robocode-dev/robocode-api-bridge) caused by the Tank
      Royale Bot APIs.
    - #119: Battle was not starting on Windows 11 and 10 after installing Docker Linux subsystem.
    - Bridged bots run multiple threads after round 2 due to old thread(s) hanging that could not be stopped.
    - Bridged bots could not be restarted as they got a connection error with the WebSocket when restarting.
    - .Net bots sometimes exited when running at max speed without any exceptions occurring.

## üì¶ 0.26.1 - Various bug fixes - 03-Nov-2024

### üöÄ Improvements

- Server:
    - When no bullets or functioning bots remain, the round ends immediately as a draw to speed things up.
- Bot API and schema:
    - The `enemyCount` field was moved from `TickEvent` for the bot (`tick-event-for-bot`) into `BotState`. This change
      provides an observer with the enemy count for each bot, which is useful for the UI to display the current enemy
      count for a specific bot. This also benefits the properties in the Bot Console.

## üì¶ 0.26.0 - Support for remote servers - 20-Oct-2024

### üöÄ Improvements

- GUI:
    - Replaced the `Server` -> `Select Server` with `Config` -> `Server Config` which makes it possible choose between
      using a local or remote server. In addition, it is possible to add, edit, and remove remote servers, and it is
      possible to specify a controller and a bot secret to allow the GUI and bots to access the remote server.
    - If a booted bot process exits, it is now removed from the active New Battle window.
- Booter:
    - When a pid of a bot process cannot be found, the Booter writes out a `load {pid}` to indicate that a process could
      not be found with the provided pid.

### üêû Bug Fixes

- GUI:
    - Control Panel was shown when server was stopped or rebooted.

## üì¶ 0.25.0 - Fix for Ranks and Event Queue improvements - 11-Oct-2024

### üêû Bug Fixes

- Server:
    - #108: The ranks were wrong as they did not reflect the total score and placements
- Bot API:
    - An interruptible event was not interrupted when `setInterruptible(true)` was called. The event queue contained
      more bot events than it should, due to this bug.
    - The event queue and dispatcher was improved so it is closer to the implementation for the original Robocode.

## üì¶ 0.24.4 - Support for IPv6 endpoints - 19-Sep-2024

### üöÄ Improvements

- GUI:
    - Improved the support for IPv6 endpoints.

### üêû Bug Fixes

- GUI:
    - #96: When starting a battle when a remote server was selected, no window was opened when starting a battle. Now an
      error message will show up plus the dialog for selecting a (local) server.
- Server
    - #85: Fixed edge case when crossing the speed of 0, when target speed is 0.

## üì¶ 0.24.3 - bug fixes - 26-Aug-2024

### üêû Bug Fixes

      version.

## üì¶ 0.24.2 - bug fixes - 22-Aug-2024

### üöÄ Improvements

- Server:
    - ~~#101: The `ServerHandshake` now includes the `GameSetup` containing information about the current game
      setup.~~

### üêû Bug Fixes

- Server
    - #102: Double events were sent to observers and controllers from the server.

## üì¶ 0.24.1 - Support for local IP addresses - 13-Jul-2024

### üöÄ Improvements

- Server:
    - #96: It is now possible to connect to the local server with local IP addresses like the wildcard IP address
      0.0.0.0, or a local IP address like e.g. 10.0.0.106 or 192.168.56.1.
- GUI:
    - Improved validation of URL when attempting to add new server URL.

## üì¶ 0.24.0 - Minor bug fixes and code improvements - 14-Jun-2024

### üöÄ Improvements

- Code:
    - Lots of code smells have been fixed in this version, and lots of code has been refactored to make it easier to
      understand and maintain.

### üêû Bug Fixes

- Bot API:
    - Sometimes the RoundEnded event was not received by a bot.
    - Java API only: `BotInfo.setGameTypes()` is now taken a Set instead of a List as input parameter.
    - Some public methods on abstract classes were changed to protected methods.
- Server:
    - Scores in the results table are now sorted, so bots with the highest total score is put in the top of the results.

    - #89: Major bug fix: Booting and unbooting multiple bots did not work anymore.

### üöÄ Improvements

- GUI:
    - Bot directories can now be enabled and disabled on the Bot Root Directories Config dialog. In addition, multiple
      directories can be selected with the file dialog, and multiple files can be removed from the Bot Root Directories
      list.

## üì¶ 0.23.1 - Fixing missing stdout and stderr messages - 18-May-2024

### üêû Bug Fixes

    - #87: Fixed shaking when bots are standing still with the recent fix in server.rules.math::calcNewBotSpeed (#85)
    - Fixed issue with the Java API, where some messages sent to stdout and stderr were not written out to the bot
      console.

## üì¶ 0.23.0 - Fixing movement bugs in bot APIs - 29-Apr-2024

### üêû Bug Fixes

- Bot API:
    - #80: Fixed a major bug causing the body, gun, and radar to move in a wrong angle, which could be seen with
      the Walls sample bot.
    - #85: Fixed a major bug in server.rules.math::calcNewBotSpeed. Thanks goes to Mark (mnbrandl) for fixing this! üòä
- Server:
    - #83: Bots receives skipped-turn-event events while dead.

### üöÄ Improvements

- Bot API:
    - Extended the GameStartedEvent with the InitialPosition property containing the starting position and shared
      direction of the body, gun, and radar. This helped on fixing #80
    - Renamed the "Angle" property of InitialPosition to "Direction".

## üì¶ 0.22.2 - Fixing issues with Bot Console - 29-Mar-2024

### üöÄ Improvements

- GUI:
    - Console windows: Added support for 8-bit and 24-bit ANSI colors.

### üêû Bug Fixes

- Bot API:
    - Entire lines output to `System.out` and `System.err` were sometimes missing in the bot console.
- GUI:
    - Bot Console: Turn numbers was sometimes written in the middle of the output, and newlines could occur in the wrong
      places.

## üì¶ 0.22.1 - GUI improvements for Linux - 07-Jan-2024

### üêû Bug Fixes

- GUI:
    - #81: Fixed tooltips they are consistent on the entire UI, and works on NixOS (Linux) as well.
    - Fixed the TPS slider, which was not displayed correctly - especially with the height.
    - Added border to the Bot Root Directories Config dialog.

### üöÄ Improvements

- GUI:
    - Improved the Bot Console and Server Console to use anti-aliased text.

## üì¶ 0.22.0 - Improved ANSI support - 03-Dec-2023

### üöÄ Improvements

- Bot API:
    - When running a bot from the command line, `stdout` and `stderr` will also be printed out in the bot console.

- GUI:
    - The Bot Console and Server Log have been totally rewritten to improve performance (is not used HTML rendering
      anymore)
    - The logo in the server log in now shown with ANSI colors per default (might not work on all systems?)
    - The bot console now writes out the turn numbers from the previous turn, when output from the bot is written out.

### üêû Bug Fixes

- GUI:
    - #75: The GUI could get stuck and become unresponsive when displaying the busy pointer on Ubuntu.
    - #77: Unreadable Server Log on NixOS.
    - The scores presented after the battle has ended was not accumulated for all rounds, and hence incorrect.
    - The Properties tab of the Bot Console did not show any values when initialized, e.g. when game is paused.
    - Some stdout text from the bot were sometimes missing in the Bot Console. Solved by using the EDT.

## üì¶ 0.21.0 - Improved scoring - 02-Oct-2023

### üöÄ Improvements

- Bot API:
    - Added `stop(boolean overwrite)` and `setStop(boolean overwrite)` to overwrite the saved movement from a previous
      call to `setStop()` with current movement values. These methods provide backwards compatibility with the original
      Robocode with the [Robocode API Bridge] (in progress).
    - Due to the removal of Java's `Thread.kill()` and .Net's `Thread.Abort()`, the main thread of the bot is no longer
      being killed by those methods is those threads could not be interrupted. Instead, the bot process it shut down
      with an error message:
      `The thread of the bot could not be interrupted causing the bot to hang. So the bot was stopped by force.`

### üêû Bug Fixes

- Scoring:
    - Fixed various scoring issues when comparing to original Robocode.
- Bot API:
    - Fixed race condition when adding custom events.

### üöÄ Improvements

- Bot Console (in GUI):
    - Added an [Events tab] on the Bot Console that continuously dumps the bot events as they occur.
    - Bot property column values on bot consoles are now written in bold and with a monospace font.

## üì¶ 0.20.0 - Added support for teams and droids - 23-Aug-2023

### üöÄ Improvements

- Team support:
    - Added support for teams, where a team is a group of bots that work together to battle against other teams (or
      bots). Each team member can communicate with the other teammates, which is crucial to share information and
      coordinate movement and attacks.
- Droid interface:
    - A **Droid** interface was added that turns a bot into a droid bot, which has no radar but has 120 initial energy
      points instead of the normal 100 starting points. The droid is intended for team bots.
- Sample Bots:
    - **MyFirstTeam** has been added to demonstrate how to set up a team.
    - **MyFirstLeader** is a team bot that has been added to demonstrate a (leader) bot that is responsible for scanning
      enemy bots and sending the coordinates of the current target, to fire at, to the teammates.
    - **MyFirstDroid** is a team bot that is a droid, and hence comes with no radar, and relies entirely on the
      MyFirstLeader to send data about which target coordinate to fire at.
- Bot API:
    - Added the `TeamMessageEvent` which is received when another team member has sent a message.
    - Added these new methods to support teams:
        - `getTeammateIds()` to get the ids of all teammates in a team.
        - `isTeammate(botId)` to check if a bot with a specific id is a teammate or opponent.
        - `broadcastTeamMessage(message)` broadcasts a message to all team members.
        - `sendMessage(botId, message)` sends a message to a specific team member.
        - `onMessageReceived(TeamMessageEvent)` is an event handler to take action when a team message is received.
    - Added the `Droid` interface (no scanner, but 120 initial energy points).
- Booter:
    - Updated to support booting teams besides bots.
    - Changed the name of the `run` command into `boot`.
    - Changed command option `-T` into `-g` for filtering game rules (`-t` is now used for the team-only option).
    - Added `--botsOnly` and corresponding `-b` option flag for filtering on bots only (excluding teams).
    - Added `--teamsOnly` and corresponding `-t` option flag for filtering on teams only (excluding bots).
- GUI:
    - Added `Directory Filter` dropdown to filter on bots and teams.
    - The results window now aggregates scores for teams as well as bots and got a wider "Name" column. Some column
      names were changed, and tooltips were added to fields containing values/scores.
- Schema:
    - Renamed `bot-results-for-bot` and `bot-results-for-observer` into `results-for-bot` and `results-for-observer` as
      participants now include teams and not just bots.

### üêû Bug Fixes

- GUI:
    - The GUI could get stuck and become unresponsive when displaying the busy pointer.

## üì¶ 0.19.3 - Maintenance - 04-Aug-2023

### üöÄ Improvements

- Server and Booter:
    - The command-line options and commands are now case-insensitive.
    - Changed `--botSecrets` and `--controllerSecrets` into `--bot-secrets` and `--controller-secrets`.
- GUI:
    - The standard output and standard error messages are now being cached within the GUI for the current round for the
      individual bots, so the history of the round is available when opening the bot consoles.
    - Changed the display name of the bot on the bot buttons and bot console title.

### üêû Bug Fixes

- Server:
    - Allow bots to connect to non-localhost addresses (PR [#69]).
- Bot API:
    - Fixed broken unit test for .Net.
- GUI:
    - Fixed issue, where the battle graphics was not displayed when starting the battle.
    - Fixed calculation of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd places.

## üì¶ 0.19.2 - Added bot properties tab - 05-Apr-2023

### üöÄ Improvements

- GUI:
    - A new Properties tab was added to the bot console, which shows the values of all bot properties for the current
      turn. This is useful for viewing the exact values and for debugging a bot.
    - When displaying an arena bigger than the window showing the battle, the window is now zooming into the battle
      arena automatically so that the visual field fits into the window.

### üêû Bug Fixes

- GUI:
    - When changing the game type for a battle, the arena did not change visually to accommodate to a new size of the
      battle arena.
- Server:
    - #66: The server is not accepting the full range of ports.

## üì¶ 0.19.1 - Maintenance - 26-Feb-2023

### üöÄ Improvements

    - Console windows for bots and the server now supports 3-bit and 4-bit [ANSI colors][ANSI escape code] (foreground
      and background) and simple text formatting.
    - Added `bot died` info to the bot console.
    - Direct3D and OpenGL acceleration is now disabled under Windows. You can add those yourself when you start up
      the GUI using the `java` command. Read more about it
      [here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/2d/flags.html).

### üêû Bug Fixes

- Server:
    - #60: The round-ended event was not sent, in the round when the game ended.
- GUI:
    - Joined Bots list was not updated (removing bots) when the game is aborted.
    - The properties `sun.java2d.d3d`, `sun.java2d.noddraw`, and `sun.java2d.opengl` is now omitted under macOS.
    - Fixed label colors for fields showing country codes (with flags).
    - Sometimes flags were "empty" when clicking on a joined bot.
- Bot API for .Net:
    - Issue where the `Game Types` field was overwritten by `Country Codes` (could be seen on the UI).

## üì¶ 0.19.0 - Added bot console windows - 28-Jan-2023

### üöÄ Improvements

- GUI:
    - A side panel has been added to the right side of the battle view with buttons for each participant bot. When
      clicking one of these buttons, a bot console window is opened that prints out the standard output (stdout) and
      standard error (stderr) from the bot.
    - Added 'OK', 'Clear', and 'Copy to clipboard' buttons to the server log window.
    - Renamed buttons named "Dismiss", used for closing dialogs, to "OK".
- Bot API:
    - When a bot is booted, its standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr) streams are redirected to the bot
      intent sent to the server, which forwards the data to the observers, making it possible to show stdout and stderr
      in the bot console windows.
    - #46: The `RoundEndedEvent` now contains a `results` field containing the accumulated results by the end of a
      round.
- Schema:
    - #46: The `round-ended-event` has been split up into `round-ended-event-for-bot` that provides only results for a
      bot,
      and `round-ended-event-for-observer` that provides the results for all bots for observers.

### üêû Bug Fixes

- Bot API:
    - `setAdjustRadarForGunTurn()` was made compatible with orig. Robocode.
    - Fixed issues with moving and turning, which could override the set target speed and turn rates, when these had
      been set explicitly on the API.

## üì¶ 0.18.0 - Improvements to the Bot APIs - 18-Dec-2022

### üêû Bug Fixes

- Bot API:
    - #52: The Bot API used comma-separated strings for `authors`, `countryCodes`, and `gameTypes` when parsing
      the `BotInfo` schema even though the [BotInfo/BotHandshake] uses string arrays. This was fixed to keep Bot APIs
      consistent with the schemas.
    - #53: Major bug where each bot received the bullet states of _all_ bullets on the battle arena, including bullets
      fired by other bots, and not just the bullets fired by the bot itself.
    - ~~Fixed issues with moving and turning, which could override the set target speed and turn rates, when these had
      been set explicitly on the API.~~
    - Reading the turn rates and target speed for the current turn did not reflect if the turn rate and/or target speed
      had been set for the current turn.
- Bot API for .Net:
    - Setting the max speed and max turn rates for the body, gun, and radar did not work.
- GUI app:
    - Fixed rendering issues on Windows (and Linux?) when using accelerated hardware, by setting these Java properties
    - as defaults:
        - `sun.java2d.d3d=false` (turn off use of Direct3D)
        - `sun.java2d.noddraw=true` (no use of Direct Draw)
        - `sun.java2d.opengl=true` (turn on OpenGL)

### üöÄ Improvements

- Bot API:
    - `addCondition()` and `removeCondition()` now returns a boolean value instead of void.
    - Condition can take an optional lambda expression as an input parameter as an alternative to overriding the test()
      method.
    - Added more test units, which did show bugs within the Bot API for both Java and .Net.
    - The event priority order was reversed to match the order used with the original Robocode.

## üì¶ 0.17.4 - Maintenance - 16-Oct-2022

### üöÄ Improvements

- Server:
    - Added `--tps` option to the server for setting the initial Turns Per Second (TPS).
    - Fire assistant is now only activated, when both the radar and gun are pointing in the same direction for two turns
      in a row (like original Robocode).
- GUI App:
    - Switched the order of the Game Type dropdown and Setup Rules button.
    - The positioning of the battle view is now controlled by dragging the mouse, instead of clicking.
    - Now sends the current tps to the server when changing game type.
    - Added `Help` menu item under the Help menu, which opens browser to the documentation of the GUI application.
- Release
    - All Java artifacts are now sent to Maven Central, i.e. Bot API, GUI Application, Server, and Booter.
    - New assets are now added to releases: Server and Booter
    - Added build scripts to automated creating (draft) releases using GitHub REST API.
    - Improved layout for release notes.
    - Optimized ProGuard rules for compressing the Booter and Server jar archives even more, making the jar archive for
      the GUI smaller as well.

### üêû Bug Fixes

- Bot API and GUI App: Fixed various concurrency issues.

## üì¶ 0.17.3 - Maintenance - 02-Oct-2022

#### ‚ö° Changes

- #43: Possibility to identify bot from Process to Tick:
    - Went back to boot process `pid` instead of using the `boot id`.

### üöÄ Improvements

- Sample bots: Improved the Fire sample bot by removing unnecessary code.

### üêû Bug Fixes

- Server:
    - The fire assistant was not always activated.
    - #45: Server is kidnapping CPU cycles
        - Game is now aborted, when the last bot participating in a battle is leaving (disconnecting).
        - Timer used for turn timeout was not stopped, when a battle had ended/aborted.
        - Freeing heap memory used for storing game state when game is ended/aborted.

## üì¶ 0.17.2 - Added sounds - 20-Sep-2022

### üöÄ Improvements

- GUI/Sounds: [#4: Fire and Explosion Sounds:
    - Added feature to play sounds to the GUI application.
    - Added Sound Options to configure sounds.
    - Note that sound files are distributed independently besides the gui application from the [sounds releases].
- GUI: Moved the ~~Dismiss~~OK button on the Bot Root Directories configuration down under the Add and Remove buttons,
  and adjusted the size of the dialog.

### üêû Bug Fixes

- GUI: When the Bot Directories on the Select Bots for Battle window is updated, all selections are now being cleared.

## üì¶ 0.17.1 - Identifying a bot from Boot-up to Ticks - 15-Sep-2022

### üöÄ Improvements

- #43: Possibility to identify bot from Process to Tick:
    - Added `sessionId` and `bootId` to these schemas: `bot-handshake`, `bot-state-with-id`, and `participants`

### üêû Bug Fixes

- Bot API:
    - The `onWonRound(WonRoundEvent)` was not triggered as soon as the round has ended.
    - The blocking turn methods for turning the body, gun, and radar invoked `go()` twice internally making the turning
      turn in "step" and take the double amount of time.
    - Some events already handled were not removed from the event queue.

## üì¶ 0.17.0 - Introduction of process id - 06-Sep-2022

The _boot id_ concept introduced in release 0.16.0 has been rolled back and the _pid_ is used with the Booter again.
However, a new concept is introduced to replace the _boot id_, which is the _process id_.

When a client (bot, controller, observer) is connecting to a server, the server will generate a unique session id and
send to the client via the `server-handshake`. The session id is used to uniquely identify the running instance of a
client, and the client _must_ send back the session id when sending its handshake to the server, e.g. a `bot-handshake`.

The _session id_ is replacing the _boot id_ as the boot id is only available with bots being booted, and which might
only be unique locally, but across multiple systems. With the _session id_, all clients have a single and unique id.

### üöÄ Improvements

- GUI:
    - Improved sorting of the bot directories list to be case-insensitive.

### üêû Bug Fixes

- Server:
    - The `server-handshake` was missing the name and version.

## üì¶ 0.16.0 - Introduction of boot id - 31-Aug-2022

### üêû Bug Fixes

- Bot API:
    - Fixed `waitFor(Condition)` so it executes before checking the condition the first time.
- Server
    - Fixed major bug where the firepower was not limited at the server side.
    - Adjusted gun to fire at gun direction for a new turn.
- GUI:
    - Issue with reading huge bot list from the booter when reading from stdin.

## üì¶ 0.15.0 - Added fire assistance - 17-Aug-2022

### üöÄ Improvements

Fire assistance:

- Added fire assistance known from the original Robocode game. Fire assistance is useful for bots with limited
  aiming capabilities as it will help the bot by firing directly at a scanned bot when the gun is fired, which is a
  very simple aiming strategy.
- When fire assistance is enabled the gun will fire towards the center of the scanned bot when all these conditions
  are met:
    - The gun is fired (`setFire` and `fire`)
    - The radar is scanning a bot _when_ firing the gun (`onScannedBot`, `setRescan`, `rescan`)
    - The gun and radar are pointing in the exact the same direction. You can call `setAdjustRadarForGunTurn(false)` to
      align the gun and radar and make sure not to turn the radar beside the gun.
- When calling `setAdjustRadarForGunTurn(true)` then fire assistance will automatically be disabled, and when calling
  `setAdjustRadarForGunTurn(false)` then fire assistance will automatically be disabled.
- Added new `setFireAssist(enable)` to enable and disable the fire assistance explicitly.

GUI:

- Updated various tooltip texts for the dialog used for starting battles.

Bot info:

- The `gamesTypes` field is no longer required with the JSON config file of a bot. When it omitted, the bot will be able
  to participate in _all_ game types. When defined, the bot will only be able to participate in battles with the game
  type(s) defined within this field.
- The `gameTypes` field has been removed from the sample bots, as all sample bots can participate in any game type.
  At least for now.

### üêû Bug Fixes

- GUI & Booter:
    - Fixed major bug as the GUI and booter did not filter out bots based on their selected game types.
    - Fixed issue with parsing JSON bot info file for the optional fields `description`, `countryCodes`, `homepage`,
      causing an issue with loading a bot, when these fields were omitted.
    - Fixed issue with parsing json content within the JSON bot info due to text encoding.
- Bot API:
    - Corrected the description of the `onScannedBot()` event handler.
- Server:
    - TPS: When TPS was set to 0 and the battle was restarted, the battle ran in max TPS.

## üì¶ 0.14.3 - Fixed setting adjustment turns - 07-Aug-2022

### üêû Bug Fixes

- GUI:
    - NullPointerException when running robocode-tankroyale-gui-0.14.2.jar ([#38])
- Server:
    - `AdjustRadarForBodyTurn` had no effect on the server side.
    - `updateBotTurnRatesAndDirections` did not work properly with adjustments for body and gun turn when
      using `setAdjustGunForBodyTurn`, `setAdjustRadarForGunTurn`, and `setAdjustRadarForBodyTurn`.
- Sample bots
    - Updated Corners to start at random corner when a new battle is started.

## üì¶ 0.14.2 - Added Velocity Bot - 29-Jul-2022

### üöÄ Improvements

- Bot API:
    - The run() method is now forced to stop/abort (in case the run method enters and infinite loop).
- Server:
    - Bots are not "sliding" along walls anymore when hitting those.
- Sample bots
    - Added _VelocityBot_ that demonstrates use of turn rates.

### üêû Bug Fixes

- Bot API:
    - Setting the turn rates with the `Bot` class did not work properly (bot, gun, and radar did not turn at all).
- Server:
    - Fixed calculation of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd places with the end results.
    - Fixed issue with restarting a game that has ended.
    - Removal of NullPointerExceptions occurring with max TPS.
- GUI:
    - TPS:
        - Loop could occur when typing in the TPS, where TPS would continuously change to different values.
        - Setting the TPS to max could be reset to default TPS when restarting the battle or GUI.
    - GUI client was registered multiple times with the server.

## üì¶ 0.14.1 - Added BotInfo builder - 14-Jul-2022

### üöÄ Improvements

- Bot API:
    - BotInfo:
        - A builder has been provided for creating `BotInfo` instances.
        - Size constraints have been added for the individual `BotInfo` fields/methods.
        - Various bug fixes for BotInfo.

- GUI:
    - The Pause/Resume and Stop button are now disabled when the battle is stopped.
- Schema:
    - Replaced `$type` with `type` to make it possible to use more code generators ([#31]).

## üì¶ 0.13.4 - GUI improvements + bug fix - 06-Jun-2022

### üêû Bug Fixes

- Bot API for Java:
    - Major bug fix with `getTurnRemaining()` ([#28]), which returned the wrong value. This could be seen with the
      sample
      bot, Crazy, which did not turn correctly.

#### Changes

- GUI:
    - **Del Key**: It is now possible to use the Del key to remove a selected bot item on the Booted Bots (to unboot),
      Joined Bots, and Selected Bot lists when selecting bots for a new battle.
    - **Unboot All**: An `‚Üê Unboot All` button has been added right below the `‚Üê Unboot` button.
    - **TPS**:
        - The last used TPS (Turns Per Second) is now restored when starting up the GUI again.
        - Added a "Default TPS" button to reset the TPS to the default setting (30 TPS).
    - **Tool tips**: Added tool tip texts on the Control panel.

## üì¶ 0.13.3 - Stabilization of Bot APIs - 01-Jun-2022

### üêû Bug Fixes

- Bot API:
    - Fix for running bots under macOS/bash when bot directory contains whitespaces ([#20]).
    - New fix for issue [#17] (Blocking bot functions do not
      stop bot after finishing)
    - Fix for `setForward(POSITIVE_INFINITE)` which moved the bot slowly forward with no
      acceleration ([#26]).
    - Fixed issue where the event queue was not disabled if `run()` method threw an exception, causing the event queue
      to reach its max limit of unprocessed 256 events.
    - Fixed issue with events being handled 1 turn later than they
      happened ([#8])
- Bot API for Java:
    - Fixed: `IllegalArgumentException: -Infinity is not a valid double value as per JSON specification`
- Server
    - Fixed various issues with invoking SkippedTurns ([#8])
- GUI:
    - When stopping a battle and starting a new one, the Pause/Resume and Stop buttons were disabled.

    - Fixed issue with rescanning and interrupting current event handler. Redesigned the event queue.
    - Fixed issue with dangling threads not been stopped (interrupted) correctly.
- Bot API for .Net:
    - Fixed issue with country codes (on macOS) which also caused boot up problems for .Net based bots running under
      macOS ([#20]).
    - Fixed issue with bots stopping doing actions when battle is restarted. E.g. the Corners sample bot was affected by
      this issue.

#### Changes

- Bot API:
    - Order of priorities was changed, so higher priority values gives higher priority.
- Sample bots:
    - Optimized TrackFire after fixing rescanning issue.

## üì¶ 0.13.0 - Bot API for .Net 6 - 03-May-2022

#### Changes

    - The id was removed from `BotResults`, and `GameEndedEvent` will only return a single `BotResult` containing
      the battle results for the bot (instead of a list containing results from all bots).
    - Added setting and getting 'adjusting radar for body turn'.
    - The `scan()` and `setScan()` methods were renamed to `rescan()` and `setRescan()`.

    - Add an `initialPosition` field in the JSON file for your bot with a value like `50,50,90` to request a starting
      coordinate at (50,50) with the bot heading toward 90¬∞.
    - A `--enable-initial-position` (or the short version `-I`) must be set to enable the initial positions feature on
      the server. If initial position is not enabled, the bot will start at a random position.
    - Initial positions can be set from the menu with Config ‚Üí Debug Options ‚Üí Enable initial start position.
    - The Target.json file of the Target sample has been updated with an `initialPosition` to demonstrate this feature.
