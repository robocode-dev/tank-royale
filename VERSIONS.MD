# Versions

## In progress

#### Bugfixes:

- Bot API:
    - Fixed `waitFor(Condition)` so it executes before checking the condition the first time.
- Server
    - Adjusted firing to fire at updated gun direction for a new turn.
- GUI:
    - Issue with reading huge bot list from the booter when reading from stdin.

## 0.15.0 - Added fire assistance - 17-Aug-2022

#### Improvements

Fire assistance:

- Added fire assistance known from the original Robocode game. Fire assistance is useful for bots with limited
  aiming capabilities as it will help the bot by firing directly at a scanned bot when the gun is fired, which is a
  very simple aiming strategy.
- When fire assistance is enabled the gun will fire towards the center of the scanned bot when all these conditions
  are met:
    - The gun is fired (`setFire` and `fire`)
    - The radar is scanning a bot _when_ firing the gun (`onScannedBot`, `setRescan`, `rescan`)
    - The gun and radar are pointing in the exact the same direction. You can call `setAdjustRadarForGunTurn(false)` to
      align the gun and radar and make sure not to turn the radar beside the gun.
- When calling `setAdjustRadarForGunTurn(true)` then fire assistance will automatically be disabled, and when calling
  `setAdjustRadarForGunTurn(false)` then fire assistance will automatically be disabled.
- Added new `setFireAssist(enable)` to enable and disable the fire assistance explicitly.

GUI:

- Updated various hover help texts for the dialog used for starting battles.

Bot info:

- The `gamesTypes` field is no longer required with the JSON config file of a bot. When it omitted, the bot will be able
  to participate in _all_ game types. When defined, the bot will only be able to participate in battles with the game
  type(s) defined within this field.
- The `gameTypes` field has been removed from the sample bots, as all sample bots can participate in any game type.
  At least for now.

#### Bugfixes:

- GUI & Booter:
    - Fixed major bug as the GUI and booter did not filter out bots based on their selected game types.
    - Fixed issue with parsing JSON bot info file for the optional fields `description`, `countryCodes`, `homepage`,
      causing an issue with loading a bot, when these fields were omitted.
    - Fixed issue with parsing json content within the JSON bot info due to text encoding.
- Bot API:
    - Corrected the description of the `onScannedBot()` event handler.
- Server:
    - TPS: When TPS was set to 0 and the battle was restarted, the battle ran in max TPS.

## 0.14.3 - Fixed setting adjustment turns - 07-Aug-2022

#### Bugfixes:

- GUI:
    - NullPointerException when running robocode-tankroyale-gui-0.14.2.jar
      ([#38](https://github.com/robocode-dev/tank-royale/issues/38))
- Server:
    - `AdjustRadarForBodyTurn` had no effect on the server side.
    - `updateBotTurnRatesAndDirections` did not work properly with adjustments for body and gun turn when
      using `setAdjustGunForBodyTurn`, `setAdjustRadarForGunTurn`, and `setAdjustRadarForBodyTurn`.
- Sample bots
    - Updated Corners to start at random corner when a new battle is started.

## 0.14.2 - Added Velocity Bot - 29-Jul-2022

#### Improvements:

    - The run() method is now forced to stop/abort (in case the run method enters and infinite loop).
- Server:
    - Bots are not "sliding" along walls anymore when hitting those.
- Sample bots
    - Added _VelocityBot_ that demonstrates use of turn rates.

#### Bugfixes:

- Bot API:
    - Setting the turn rates with the `Bot` class did not work properly (bot, gun, and radar did not turn at all).
- Server:
    - Fixed calculation of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd places with the end results.
    - Fixed issue with restarting a game that has ended.
    - Removal of NullPointerExceptions occurring with max TPS.
- GUI:
    - TPS:
        - Loop could occur when typing in the TPS, where TPS would continuously change to different values.
        - Setting the TPS to max could be reset to default TPS when restarting the battle or GUI.
    - GUI client was registered multiple times with the server.

        - Added missing game type for "classic" game + updated documentation.

## 0.14.0 - Adjustments for bot events - 03-Jul-2022

#### Changes:

- Bot API:
    - Adjusted the bot events to make it easier to make a bridge between legacy Robocode bots and Tank Royale later
      ([#12](https://github.com/robocode-dev/tank-royale/issues/12)).
    - Introduced `BotDeathEvent` and `HitByBulletEvent`.
    - Made priority values for`DefaultEventPriority` public, and changed event priority order to match the original
      Robocode game.
    - Bot event priorities can now be read and changed.
- GUI:
    - The Pause/Resume and Stop button are now disabled when the battle is stopped.
- Schema:
    - Replaced `$type` with `type` to make it possible to use more code generators

## 0.13.4 - GUI improvements + bugfix - 06-Jun-2022

#### Bugfixes:

- Bot API for Java:
    - Major bugfix with `getTurnRemaining()` ([#28](https://github.com/robocode-dev/tank-royale/issues/28)), which
      returned the wrong value. This could be seen with the sample bot, Crazy, which did not turn correctly.

#### Changes:

- GUI:
    - **Del Key**: It is now possible to use the Del key to remove a selected bot item on the Booted Bots (to unboot),
      Joined Bots, and Selected Bot lists when selecting bots for a new battle.

    - **TPS**:
        - The last used TPS (Turns Per Second) is now restored when starting up the GUI again.
        - Added a "Default TPS" button to reset the TPS to the default setting (30 TPS).
    - **Tool tips**: Added tool tip texts on the Control panel.

      stop bot after finishing)
    - Fix for `setForward(POSITIVE_INFINITE)` which moved the bot slowly forward with no
      acceleration ([#26](https://github.com/robocode-dev/tank-royale/issues/26)).
    - Fixed issue where the event queue was not disabled if `run()` method threw an exception, causing the event queue
      to reach its max limit of unprocessed 256 events.

    - The id was removed from `BotResults`, and `GameEndedEvent` will only return a single `BotResult` containing
      the battle results for the bot (instead of a list containing results from all bots).
    - Added setting and getting 'adjusting radar for body turn'.
    - The `scan()` and `setScan()` methods were renamed to `rescan()` and `setRescan()`.

    - Replaced the environment variable BOT_URL (deprecated) with BOT_HOMEPAGE.
- Bot API for .Net:
    - Added missing public Bot(BotInfo, Uri, string serverSecret) constructor.

#### Changes

- Implemented initial position feature:
    - Add an `initialPosition` field in the JSON file for your bot with a value like `50,50,90` to request a starting
      coordinate at (50,50) with the bot heading toward 90°.
    - A `--enable-initial-position` (or the short version `-I`) must be set to enable the initial positions feature on
      the server. If initial position is not enabled, the bot will start at a random position.
    - Initial positions can be set from the menu with Config → Debug Options → Enable initial start position.
    - The Target.json file of the Target sample has been updated with an `initialPosition` to demonstrate this feature.
- Updated the SpinBot sample bot for C# to demonstrate the use of `BotInfo.FromConfiguration(IConfiguration)`.
- The config file named `misc.properties` has been renamed into `config.properties` and the `server-url` setting was
  moved to the `server.properties` file.
- When the server settings are changed on the GUI, the user will be asked if the server should be rebooted to let the
  changes take effect.
