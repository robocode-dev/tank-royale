description: |
  The intent (request) sent from a bot each turn for controlling the bot and provide the server with data.
  A field only needs to be set, if the value must be changed. Otherwise the server will use the field value from the
  last time the field was set.

properties:
  turnRate:
    description: |
      Turn rate of the body in degrees per turn (can be positive and negative).
      Server clamps the effective turn rate each tick based on current speed: see limitTurnRate(speed).
      Omitting this field means no change from previous intent.
    type: number
  gunTurnRate:
    description: |
      Turn rate of the gun in degrees per turn (can be positive and negative).
      Server clamps to the allowed range each tick.
      Omitting this field means no change from previous intent.
    type: number
  radarTurnRate:
    description: |
      Turn rate of the radar in degrees per turn (can be positive and negative).
      Server clamps to the allowed range each tick.
      Omitting this field means no change from previous intent.
    type: number
  targetSpeed:
    description: |
      New target speed in units per turn (can be positive and negative).
      Server applies acceleration/deceleration and clamps to the allowed speed range each tick.
      Omitting this field means no change from previous intent.
    type: number
  firepower:
    description: |
      Attempt to fire the gun with the specified firepower.
      Server rules apply when executing intents:
      - Firing only occurs when the gun is cool (gunHeat == 0) and the bot has more energy than the requested firepower.
      - Firepower below the server minimum will not fire; when firing, the effective firepower is clamped to the server range [MIN_FIREPOWER, MAX_FIREPOWER] (currently [0.1, 3.0]).
      - Values above the maximum are clamped to the maximum.
      - Omitting this field means "no change"; typical clients omit it when not firing.
    type: number
    minimum: 0.0
    maximum: 3.0
