description: >-
  Event occurring when a message has been received from a teammate.
  Inherits the required 1-based `turnNumber` from `event.schema.yaml`.
  The event is delivered privately to a teammate (either a specific recipient
  or all teammates when broadcast). Server-side limits apply: each bot can send
  at most `MAX_NUMBER_OF_TEAM_MESSAGES_PER_TURN` team messages per turn, and a
  single team message must not exceed `MAX_TEAM_MESSAGE_SIZE` bytes/characters.
  If one message exceeds the size limit, that message and any following team
  messages in the same turn are ignored by the server.
