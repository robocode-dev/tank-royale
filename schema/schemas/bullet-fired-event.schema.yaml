      Bullet that was fired. The bullet state is a snapshot taken at the exact moment of firing:
      - Position (`x`,`y`) reflects the firing bot's position at fire time.
      - Direction is normalized to the [0, 360) range.
      - Firepower is clamped by the server to its allowed range [0.1, 3.0]; higher values are capped and lower values will not fire.
      - Color equals the bot's `bulletColor` at fire time; bullets already fired do not change color afterwards.
