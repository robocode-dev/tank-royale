description: >-
  Snapshot of all bots currently connected to the server.
  Extends message.schema.yaml and therefore includes the required `type` field
  with value `BotListUpdate`.
  Emitted to observers/controllers whenever a bot joins or leaves, and when a
  client connects and requests the current list. The list may be empty when no
  bots are connected. Order is not guaranteed and should not be relied upon.

      Complete list of currently connected bots (full replacement, not a delta).

      address info (`host`, `port`). The array may be empty.
