package dev.robocode.tankroyale.botapi

/**
 * Droid interface to turn your bot into a droid bot, which is used as a specialized team bot.
 * A droid has 20 additional energy points (120 in total from the start), but has no scanner!<br></br>
 * <br></br>
 * Because the droid has no scanner, it is 100% dependent on other team members to perform the scanning on its behalf
 * and communicate crucial information to the bot, e.g., the coordinates of target enemies.<br></br>
 * <br></br>
 * A team of droids plus at least one non-droid team robot can have an edge over another team without droids (and the
 * same number of robots) due to the additional 20 energy points.
