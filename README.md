## 🤖 About

Robocode is a [programming game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_game) where the goal is to code a bot in the
form of a virtual tank that competes against other bots in a virtual battle arena.

The player writes a program that controls the bot’s movement, scanning, firing, and reactions to events during a battle.
All logic lives inside this program – you never control the bot directly.

The name **Robocode** is short for “Robot code” and comes from the original version
[here](https://robocode.sourceforge.io/).  
**Robocode Tank Royale** is the next evolution, where bots can play over the Internet via WebSocket.

This project aims to help you learn programming, improve AI skills in a fast‑running real‑time game,
and have fun while competing.

### The Book of Robocode

[**The Book of Robocode**](https://book.robocode.dev/) 📖 is a comprehensive guide covering Robocode as well as
Robocode Tank Royale—from basics to advanced strategies like wave surfing, guess-factor targeting, and
movement techniques. It builds on two decades of community knowledge and foundational research from RoboWiki
contributors.

### 🚀 Try it out

If you are new to Robocode or just need a refresher, start with the
[Getting Started guide](https://robocode-dev.github.io/tank-royale/tutorial/getting-started).  
For hands‑on coding, continue to the
[My First Bot tutorial](https://robocode-dev.github.io/tank-royale/tutorial/my-first-bot.html).

The [Installation guide](https://robocode-dev.github.io/tank-royale/articles/installation.html) covers how to install the GUI,
and includes sample bots for quick demos.
